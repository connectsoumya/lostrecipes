#### Prepare the spice mix

1. Heat a pan and add 1 tsp coriander, 1 tsp cumin, 2 dried chilli and dry roast it. Let it cool down.

2. Use a mortar and pestle or spice grinder to grind the roasted spices.


#### Prepare the bora/vada (fritters)

3. Soak 200g urad dal overnight or 8 hrs.
4. Grind soaked urad dal, 10g ginger, some salt and 2 green chillies to form a smooth paste.
5. Now whisk the batter for 5 to 6 minutes until fluffy. (Put a drop of batter in a glass of water and check. If it floats then its ready. If the batter sinks you need to whisk it more. Please follow the video for a better explanation.)
6. In a pan heat oil for deep frying. When the oil gets quite hot pour the batter as round shaped bora or fritters (see video). Fry until golden.
7. In a bowl take lukewarm water, add 1/2 tsp asafoetida and 1/2 tsp fennel seed. Add the fried bora (fritters) and set aside for 15 minutes. This process helps the bora (fritters) become soft and enhances the flavour. 
In a bowl add 100g of yoghurt, 1/2 tsp of black salt, 1 tsp of sugar, some ground spice mix and blend well.

#### Assembly

8. Now remove the excess water from the bora by pressing gently (follow the video) and place it in the serving plate.
9. Pour the yoghurt mixture on top, add tamarind chutney and green chutney on top of the yoghurt, and sprinkle the rest of the ground spice mix and some red chilli powder.

Doi bora is now ready to serve
