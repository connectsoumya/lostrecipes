2. In the mean time we will be making the dough for the flat bread. In a bowl add flour, 1tbsp of cooking oil, salt Â½ tsp and mixed it well. After that add water and make a smooth dough. 

3. Break one egg in a bowl and beat it with salt. And set aside because we need this when we fry the bread. We need one egg for each serving.

4. Now we take a flour dough ball and make a flat bread with the roller pin. Then brush oil on it and roll the flatbread and make another dough ball as shown in the video. Heat a pan with 2 tbsp of oil and put the flat bread on the pan. Then fry both sides very well in medium flame. When the bread is half fried, put it aside. After that in the same pan add 1tbsp of oil and add the beaten egg. After that place the fried flat bread on the egg and cook the egg properly. 

5. Then shift the whole bread with egg in a plate. In a side of a bread add the chicken mixture, chopped green chilli, lime juice, tomato sauce, chat masala and black salt and roll it. 

The egg chicken roll is ready now. Enjoy your meal.
