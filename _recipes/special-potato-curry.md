2. Heat a pan, add 1 tsp of coriander seed, 1 tsp of cumin seed and 1 tsp of dried chilli whole or flakes. Let it cool down and crush to form a fine powder. 

3. Take potato cut into small pieces (as shown in the video) with skin (IMPORTANT!!! Do not remove the skin). Heat 2-3 tbsp oil in a pan. Add 1/2 tsp panch foron, 2 dried red chillies or 1 tsp chilli flakes and 1/2 tsp asafoetida. Stir well. Next add the potatoes. 

4. When the potato starts turning golden yellow add salt to taste and 1/2 tsp sugar and mix well. 

5. Crush the ginger and green chilli to form a paste and mix it well with potatoes. Then add 1/2 tsp of chilli powder, 1/2 tsp of coriander powder and 1/2 tsp of cumin powder and stir well. Add little water (about 1/2 glass) in this stage. 

6. When all spices are mixed together add some more water and cover it for 5 minutes. Then add boiled or soaked chana dal and a green chilli, stir it and cover it for another 5 minutes or till the chana dal is cooked. 

7. Add the crushed roasted spice (made in step 2) and mix well. 

The special potato curry is ready to enjoy. It goes best with [__*Hing Kachori*__](http://www.lostauthenticrecipes.com/hing-kachori) or [__*Dal Puri*__](http://www.lostauthenticrecipes.com/dal-puri).
