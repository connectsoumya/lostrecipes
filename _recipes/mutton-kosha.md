1. To a grinder jar add 100 g of quartered onions, 5 g of roughly chopped garlic, 100 g yogurt, 15 g cinnamon, turmeric, and shahi garam masala. Lightning to form a smooth paste. Coat all the pieces of the mutton with the marinade, making sure the meat gets into all the nooks and crannies. Cover and allow the mutton to marinate for about 8 hours in the refrigerator.
2. Cut the onions into thin slices for 400 g. Sliced onions for this recycle describe the curry's texture. Diced, sliced, or pureed onions will not produce the same result for you. Crush together 10 g of garlic and 20 g of green chillies to a paste using a mortar and pestle. You may also cut all the bay leaves in 3-cm pieces using a pair of scissors for ease when stirring later on.
3. Heat a big kadai and add to it mustard oil. Add the dried red chillies, bay leaves, cinnamon, green cardamom, black cardamom, and cloves once the oil has started smoking gently and changed colour to a pale yellow. Add the onions and fry them for about 15 minutes on medium flame until light brown in colour. Then add the paste of the ginger and the paste of the garlic and green chilli, and fry for another 5 minutes. Keep the flame medium to low and stir regularly, depending on whether the onions stick to the pan or not. We want the spices to be fried and the onions to develop colour. 
4. Next add the dry spices mixed with 100 g of water (coriander, cumin, and red chilli). Continue to fry the onions and the spices for another 15 minutes. Your onions should have taken on a reddish-brown colour by now (it's been 30 minutes since we started), and the spices began releasing their oils. Add the marinated stirrup to the pan. The mutton was in the refrigerator so it is cold. Raise fire, and thoroughly mix everything. Fry the mutton on high heat for 15 minutes, stirring frequently to check that it is not sticking to the pan. 
5. Beat 150-200 g yogurt and add to the pan until it is lump-free. At this stage, add 8 g of salt and 10 g of sugar too. Mix everything together and start to cook. Once the moisture starts to dry out (from the cold mutton and yogurt), reduce the heat to a low. 
6. Now, there isn't much to it. On medium heat, repeat the following steps for the next 75 to 90 minutes. Add a splash of hot water to the pan (~30 ml at a time) stir it in cover the pan and cook for a minute â€“ Uncover and mix it thoroughly. Stir, scrape, and add any of the browned bits that may have stuck to the bottom of the pan, as this will allow the mother to produce a rich colour. Be warning, however, so the gravy isn't burning and turning bitter. Keep cooking the meat in the sauce, adding water a little at a time. 
7. Once you are pleased with the colour, add as much water as you want for the gravy / curry. For flavour add around 4 slit green chillies. Cover and cook until tender to the mutton. Two thumbs should be able to tear this apart. Turn off the heat and then top off with some ghee. Cover and leave it to rest for 2 minutes before serving.
