My name is Suparna Chowdhury and I am very passionate about cooking. 
When I was a teenager, I developed my interest in cooking. 
I started cooking with simple recipes which didn’t involve a lot of spices or any complex steps. 
With time, I learnt more about this art. 
Now I make my everyday food, sometimes with my husband who is also a great cook. 
We always share our knowledge with each other and improve our skills. 
I prefer authentic recipes and make everything from scratch and that’s what I am going to teach you. 
Cooking from scratch might sound a bit time consuming but trust me, it’s worth the time. 
Every cuisine represents the culture of the country, but now a days people are so busy with their life that many people cannot even cook their daily meals. 
In fact, some recipes are already lost. 
For example, our grandparents in India used to make various pickles at home, but now most mothers cannot make such good pickles, forget about this generation. 
I do a lot of research about food and learn the authentic way of cooking them. 
Cooking is an art, which now-a-days are lost, thanks to the takeaways and frozen foods. 
I want to revive the art of cooking and pass it to everyone. 
Please visit my Youtube channel **LostAuthenticRecipes**.
I will soon be launching an android application where you can find these recipes.
